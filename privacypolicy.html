<p style="text-align: justify">It is the responsibility of the person inputting the information to ensure any required consent is in place. When we refer to legitimate interests we mean the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). We do not generally undertake automated decision making using your personal data except when processing a payment via card e.g. automatic refusal if credit reference checks show bad risk via a merchant provider.
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">MARKETING/PROMOTIONAL OFFERS</strong>
<br /><br />
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing. Where you have agreed to receive it, we may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which goods, services and offers may be relevant for you. We will only share your personal data for marketing purposes in accordance with your preferences/consent. You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting us.

Avalanche respects the privacy of all visitors to our website. We specifically designed this website to use as little cookies as possible and you may notice you did not see a popup appear when landing.  We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect any changes in technology or legislation affecting the way we use cookies and how you, as a user, can manage them.
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">WHAT IS A COOKIE?</strong>
<br /><br />
A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time. Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete them whenever they like.

Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also helps us to improve our site.

This site uses several low level cookies which can be accessed through the site information tab and are present in 99.6% of sites online.

* Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email. and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.

<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">CHANGE OF PURPOSE</strong>
<br /><br />
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
<br /><br />
We may have to share your personal data with the categories of parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.
<br /><br />
    Other companies within the European Economic Area involved in providing goods and/or services to you, whether directly or providing underlying infrastructure services.
    External third parties, including:
    <br /><br />
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you;<br />
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our services and website;<br />
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> professional advisers, including lawyers, banks, auditors and insurers;<br />
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Revenue Commissioners, regulators and other authorities;<br />
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> entities involved in credit checking and anti-fraud activities, crime prevention/detection, risk assessment and management and dispute resolution.<br />
    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Third parties whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
    <br /><br />
Where these third parties are our processors, we require them to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party processors to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. Some of the third parties mentioned above, for example, many professional advisers and Revenue Commissioners, are controllers who, like us, are subject to specific obligations under data protection law, and who will have their own privacy notices setting out how they deal with personal data.
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong>
<br /><br />
Though we do not seek actively to transfer personal data outside the EEA, some of the external third parties we deal with are based outside the EEA or process personal data outside the EEA, so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we look to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
<br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Transferring your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.<br />
    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.<br />
    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.
    <br /><br />
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">7. DATA SECURITY</strong>
<br /><br />
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. Processors we appoint will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">8. DATA RETENTION</strong>
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</strong>
<br /><br />
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Details of retention periods for different types of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting us.
<br /><br />OR<br /><br />
By law, we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax & audit purposes. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information. In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>
<br /><br />
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please see below to find out more about these rights:
<br /><br />
    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request access to your personal data.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request correction of your personal data.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request erasure of your personal data.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Object to processing of your personal data.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request restriction of processing your personal data.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request transfer of your personal data.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Right to withdraw consent.<br /><br />

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to enable us to deal with your request or to speed up our response. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or we have received a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
<br /><br />
<strong style="font-size: 25px">YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>
<br /><br />
You have the right to:<br /><br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on our legitimate interest (or that of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following situations:<br /><br />
    
        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;<br />

        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;<br />

        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or<br />

        <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br />

        <br />
    Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
    <br /><br />
    Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

    <br /><br />

<strong style="font-size: 25px">10. MONITORING</strong>
<br /><br />
We may monitor and/or record:<br /><br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> telephone calls;<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> transactions and activities at all points of contact;<br />

    <i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i> web, traffic and activities<br /><br />

These are to ensure that we carry out your instructions accurately, for training purposes and to improve our services, and to ensure security and prevent fraud. For the greater security of our customers and staff, and to prevent and detect crime, we use CCTV in and around our premises. To obtain information about our use of CCTV you can contact us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<strong style="font-size: 25px" id="payment">PAYMENT POLICY</strong><br /><br />
The standard Avalanche procedure is to take a 50% deposit on all projects. For our clients’ convenience, we are flexible in increasing/decreasing this percentage with a minimum of 30% needed up front to secure Avalanche as your digital partner. All deposits paid on site are non-refundable. Avalanche dedicate research hours and development work from the initial contact with a client and this is evident in the world class standard of our work.
    <br /><br />

    <strong style="font-size: 25px" id="wellbeing">WELLBEING POLICY</strong><br /><br />
In the event of a client becoming abusive towards Avalanche or a general breakdown of communication and respect towards Avalanche, we reserve the right to walk away from any contracts, be it verbal or written, with the exception of a legally signed document. Whilst we will endeavour to amicably resolve any situation, the wellbeing and mental health of our staff will always come first.
