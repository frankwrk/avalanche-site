                                   <p style="text-align: justify">I do these "anniversary" posts every year for Avalanche, mostly because they are a good measure of how things are going and to update those who follow us and enjoy my rambling, a tiny bit because I promise myself, I will write something at least once a month and this means I only have 11 other articles I need to create!<br />
                                       <br />
                                       These are the couple of days I allow myself to be a little nostalgic and to be quite honest, I allow myself a little pat on the back for how far we have come. It has been a beautiful and painful journey with lots of ups and downs along the way, mostly ups I am happy to report.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       Jesus, the fact that I use “we” instead of “I” is a measure of success in and of itself. Avalanche has grown well beyond the wildest dreams I allowed myself to have when I was coding on the floor & walls of my parent’s box room.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       <strong>June 15th, 3.23 pm.</strong><br />
                                       <br />
                                       This is the date in 2012 that Avalanche popped out of my head and onto the internet. I still remember the moment vividly, 9 years later as my first child’s birthdate. I have mentioned on several posts/podcasts that Avalanche has come to define who I am as a person, it is the most defining thing about my personality, it has allowed me to grow into the best possible version of myself, something I & many others never thought likely.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       Whether it has been hard work or simply dumb luck, or a combination of things, I owe it everything.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       Personally speaking, Avalanche has granted me financial freedom, it has allowed me to travel the world, continuously give back to communities, sponsor multiple charities and even invest in 11 other businesses.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       I know that I am incredibly lucky that this has all worked out & my biggest hope on this 9th anniversary is that I can instil a source of inspiration in some other entrepreneurs, both locally and internationally, there has been a real uptake in people starting a side gig, leaving full-time employment to take a chance, backing themselves and their passion.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       Just from my own feeds, I love seeing people doing this, friends & their wider circle, whether it is a vintage clothing store, a carpentry business, a podcast, tech startup or everything else in between. People shaking off what society tells them they should do and are brave enough to step outside the norm, those are my favourite kind of people. Those are the game-changers.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       At least an hour or two a week of my time is spent replying to messages from all walks of life about starting a business/how to tackle an issue in their business and whether I give sage advice or if I am just a soundboard, it is something I really enjoy doing.
                                       <br />
                                       <br />
                                       I would hope that people in that start-up position would look at Avalanche in their low days (which will come) & know that if I can do this, literally anyone can. I am not gifted with anything but a ridiculous work ethic that has grown with the demands I place on myself.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       I would also hope that they would be able to do something I could not do and honestly still struggle with to this day, ask for help, from those who have come before you. My email/DMs are always open to such people.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       Not only will it help with the immediate problems you are having in business, but it will also allow you to realise that you are not alone in your endeavour and sharing your passion with someone is always a good thing, particularly with an objective person who will be able to point out the weaknesses both you & your business possess.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       People, even friends & family literally laughed in my face 9 years ago when I told them my goals and plans for Avalanche.
                                       <br />
                                       <br />
                                       <strong>Nobody laughs now.</strong><br />
                                       <br />
                                       So set out your goals, follow your gut and block out those who say you cannot do something.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       Avalanche was founded with several goals in mind, but the ultimate goal has always been making the internet a better place, make it a calmer, safer and more beautiful space for all users worldwide.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       That goal is unattainable, I know it is, the internet will forever remain toxic and dark in places, but I have come to learn that they have a place as well, but having an unattainable goal is not the worst thing in the world.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       I mean I go to the gym to look like Chris Hemsworth, that is never going to happen but that does not mean I cannot aim for it. If I get 50% there, that is a win in my book!<br />
                                       <br />
                                       On behalf of everyone at Avalanche, I would like to say a colossal thank you to everyone who has contributed in some way in the last 9 years, to those who trust Avalanche in their business, to everyone who has toiled with us, followed, shared, liked, or mentioned along the way. Every single person who has taken the time to ask how it is going, taken a minor interest, I appreciate it all.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       I genuinely did not think we would reach the 10-year milestone over the short course of Avalanche’s life for many different reasons, but it is now in sight, for a long time, I did not even think I would be involved anymore but I am beyond grateful that I am and for the continued trust and support shown to us from people worldwide.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       From small local businesses to billion-dollar (madness) companies, we appreciate every single client who places their trust in Avalanche to further their online presence. This trust and 
                                       the relationships that we build is the core element in all of our work.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       We will continue to push forward to create better solutions, flirt with the boundaries of design, eCommerce, code and strive to be the absolute best that we can be.<br />

                                       After nine years, I still have that giddy excitement every morning when I start up my system, the computers and surroundings have drastically improved but what remains is the Benmore-bred hunger to be better and scrap for everything. It is something I do not think will ever leave me; I pray it never does.<br />
                                       <br />
                                       I feel like we have only scratched the surface of what Avalanche are capable of, it is incredibly exciting to think about where we will be in 2030, after another 9 years, the painful start-up period has come and gone. Now, it is time to cement our legacy & I approach every year with bigger goals to grow, be better and push the limits of what is possible with our code.<br />
