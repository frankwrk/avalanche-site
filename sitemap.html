						<br /><small>The short answer is, a lot. Colour is incredibly important when it comes to the design of a website. It is one of the most powerful ways of subconsciously letting a visitor know what you and your product are about. It is an extension of you, your untold hours of hard work and as such it warrants a lot more thought then you may initially think.</small>

Since as long as I can remember I have never been someone to fret over much, looking over the biggest parts of my life, exams, awards, meetings, big games etc. I have never really been prone to nerves, I&apos;ve always approached things in a light-hearted manner.</small>

						<br /><small>It is said that nothing great ever came from a comfort zone, that a person must be stretching at all times to get to that next level regardless of their field. Only by moving outside of your &apos;comfort zone&apos; can you expand your learning and move on to greater things in life, etc. In my limited experience I have not found this to be true and find it a load of crap to be honest.</small>
