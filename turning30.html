                                                    It is February 20th, 2020. A dull Thursday afternoon as I sit down to write this article. Something I have been planning on doing for a while, but I haven’t had the time, to be honest. I usually try to aim for one article a month on this blog, but the days seem to slip away quicker than ever before now due to a never-ending to-do list I run over in my head.
                                                    I have 4 days left before I have the pleasure of turning 30 years old on the 24th of February 2020 & make no mistake, it is a pleasure, and it is something that I am actively looking forward to. I have come to realise, like Jenna Rink after a brief internal battle in <i>13 going on 30</i>, it can be pretty sweet to be thirty, flirty & thriving.</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                                    It seems like a milestone that is ever-present on the horizon for the whole world once you turn 25. The arrival of your fourth decade is 
                                                    nigh and it is portrayed as something you should be dreading no matter how carefully you curate your social feeds.
                                                    A lot of the time, it can feel like everyone wants you to be terrified of turning 30. As though the only suitable way to feel about entering this new decade is nervous, sad and overly devastated by the ‘loss of your youth’.</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                                    Whisper it quietly as it may not be a popular opinion but being <strong>30 is far better than being 20</strong>, especially in today’s kinda horrifying world. I’m not saying that turning 30 isn’t a big deal. Any birthday with a ‘0’ is important and will unavoidably warrant a certain amount of self-reflection but these landmarks should be celebrated, not bemoaned.</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                                    The “free” swing you get at life when you are a young twenty-something is wildly liberating as you are free from the shackles of parents, studies, overbearing sporting schedules and whatever else weighs you down in the formative years of your life. You can be anyone you want and do anything you set your mind to.
                                                    Your 20s are characterised by discovery, they are supposed to be. We spend much of the decade working out what we like & don’t like; in what we want to do, what we wear, in our relationships & how we wish to present ourselves to the world. This that means we end up putting up with a lot of shit while we are figuring it all out.
                                                    Personally speaking, the most significant change between my early 20s and hitting 30 is that I now know who I am, and I back myself.</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                                    If your 20s are for figuring stuff out, your 30s is the decade of certainty. You are more confident and if you have done your 20s right, you will have no qualms about turning 30 whatsoever. It is 
                                                    probably the first adult milestone where you will have regrets about what you have not done, 
                                                    what you have not accomplished and what may have simply passed you by.
                                                    The only people who are anxious about turning 30 are those who believe that they did not achieve what they set out to do in their 20’s 
                                                    &amp; make no bones about it; you won’t be a 20-something year old long.</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                                    Procrastination will become your enemy and it will take you a long time to beat it down.
                                                    Your time is limited so don’t waste it living someone else’s life & doing what you think you should. 
                                                    For example, going by Instagram, you would think that travelling will somehow help you figure it all out, it’s almost like influencers with 0 personality do it for easy content to portray that they are successful. Surprising isn’t it?</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                                    Yeah, it’s cool jumping around the world when you are 23 but it is shite craic to be out on the pull at 28 and taking someone back to your parent’s house. By your late 20’s the floor just isn’t as appealing an option as it was in College.
                                                    That is why I would recommend having a 5-year plan, not a 5 week or a 5-month plan. Take the short-term pain for a long-term reward. If you are not moving forward; you are simply standing still & that is the worst thing that you can do in this life. Instead of a budget trip to Ibiza for Instagram, maybe upskill at something?</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                                    I mean, if you want to drink WKD and get an STD, just go to a seaside town in Ireland. Food for thought.</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify">
                                                    Of course, regular readers of this blog will know that it is easy for me to say all of this from my high horse. I am an incredibly lucky person, I know that. By all accounts I have everything sorted out. I have carved out a successful career, I own my dream house & I am engaged to a beautiful woman who is a lot smarter than me, so I am marrying up. Believe me,
                                                    I am as surprised as anyone, this was not how I thought things would go for me at 30. I hit the jackpot.</p>

                                                    Much like any piece of hardware that is 30 years old, somethings just are not like they used to be.
                                                    As I have always been the baby, I am the last of my friend group to turn 30 so I have been hearing it for a while & I can confirm it. Once you hit 30, your body just starts to shut down. Aches that you have never felt before begin appearing out of nowhere as if the universe knows it is now time to start shutting you down.</p>

                                                    So, with my two knees knackered from a lifetime of abuse, this is the first real-time in my life where I can’t play. It is tough to take as sport is probably a big reason why I became an entrepreneur. It is ultra-competitive, and I love to compete. I have a neurotic, obsessive need to win. I always have & high-end business is like having a championship final every day. I am pretty sure I am addicted to the rush. I think that is 
                                                    a big part of why you see a lot of sports stars move into business on retirement.</p>

                                                    I have also been warned about my metabolism FINALLY slowing down and if it does, I am in big trouble. I go to the gym a lot, mostly because it is good for my headspace, otherwise, I am just working all the time.
                                                    The gym forces me to spend at least an hour a day away from the office & more than that, it enforces a routine into your life that lends itself well to your professional life.</p>

                                                    Similar to the army’s method of dressing your bed every morning, you start your day with a small number of easy tasks done well and the harder tasks become more manageable.
                                                    So I start my day with a workout to shake off the cobwebs which means the gym side of 
                                                    my life is good, after learning all there is to know in my 20s, I now know how my body works and what it needs in terms of exercise & weights. if you feel good, you look good so that is not a problem.</p>

                                                    What I have yet to commit to, is the diet side of things. In all honesty, I have never really had to, putting on weight when I first started going to the gym was my problem and luckily this is still the case (barring last year when I had to lose 3KG which may spell the beginning of a need for change). Some of my friends just need to look at a packet of biscuits
                                                    and they will put on weight, so they need to be a lot stricter with themselves. Considering, I put no effort into my diet whatsoever and I have a drawer in my office reserved entirely for Maltesers, I will probably need to make some minor changes.</p>

                                                    My metabolism slowing down is a slight concern. I may even need to begin eating some of those green things that Stephanie keeps cooking and I keep throwing away. Sure, I could have a six-pack if I really wanted to, but life is too short to ever turn down some pizza because it doesn’t fit your macros. I guess I will just cross that bridge when I come to it, hopefully, I will do so with two functioning knees.</p>

                                                    world of technology, this can be a tough statement to put your stock in. As a man who will soon be 30, I am fully aware that whilst I have years of working experience behind me, there’s still another 35 years (at least) ahead of me before hitting retirement age. Now, I love what I do so I am sure it will evolve to other aspects as the years roll by. In a few years, I may not even recognise my day to day work routine.</p>

                                                    I mentioned earlier that if you are standing still, by default you are getting passed by someone. This is never truer than in the world of technology & running your own company. I have alluded to it before, but I am not particularly gifted at what I do, I just work a lot harder than any of my competitors. That is what has allowed us to rise to the top of a particularly cut-throat industry.</p>

It may be my youthful complexion (thanks L'Oréal!) or my inability to grow facial hair but without fail, every single new client I meet will ask me my age and they are all genuinely surprised to hear I have been doing this for the most of a decade at this point.</p>

                                                    I have been daydreaming lately of meeting myself at 22 when I first started Avalanche & how that interaction would go. A headstrong kid who had no real idea about what he is doing versus me as a headstrong 30-year-old. Not much has changed in truth, I am just better dressed and my views on the world are widened.
                                                    When I run through this little imaginary meeting in my head, I get comfort from the fact that I would comfortably beat him in any professional scenario, and this allays my fear for a little while.</p>

                                                    I have realised that it is on me to take that fear of being left behind in the tech world and put it into something positive. The blend of youth and experience is still on my side and I am confident that I can make my dent in the tech universe before I see the end of another decade.
                                                    It may sound corny but if you love what you are doing and you do it well, everything will just fall into place.</p>

                                                    Inevitably this fails because of the essence of all successful people in business or sport or whatever yardstick you quantify success by is the people themselves and what I have learned in 8 years that if you are not projecting yourself, you are not going to last long.</p>
