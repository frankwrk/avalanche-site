We were looking for a website developer for a while and had researched many. What we liked most about Avalanche Designs was their friendliness, prompt responses, professional manner in dealing with all enquiries and their cost competitiveness. They never made us feel stupid for asking stupid questions and were very patient. Their previous work portfolio looked good and was easy to explore.
We are very happy with the work Avalanche have done. Aidan really understood what we were looking for. We hope to launch our new site in the next week and can't wait to see the impact this will make to our business.

He calmly reassured me that the difficulties that I had envisaged were completely surmountable and over the next few weeks continued to communicate clearly and quickly what I needed to do. He was very patient with me when I was slow with edits and understanding the technology involved and he worked through the weekend of the All-Ireland final to ensure we launched on the 1st September! We were delighted with the end product which has gotten great feedback and I would highly recommend Avalanche for any business particularly start up like ourselves.

When I came to the team I only had a domain name. Now it's a functioning website.

My lack of knowledge wasn't even a factor the team took on the task and gave me more than I expected.

What I appreciated most was the personalised service. Aidan was right on hand to deal with any questions (however stupid or mundane), issue or changes I had. Responding to my emails rapidly and showing lots of patience where my lack of knowledge was concerned.

Not only to get the website up and running but continuing into the future I'm glad I went with Avalanche.

We could not be happier with our new website and throughout the entire process Aidan was professional, courteous and just a generally lovely guy to deal with.

Our home build website was on its last legs and it was seriously impacting our business and functionality at a critical time of year for us. We knew we were pushing it when we asked for a quick turnaround on a website that holds 2000+ products but Aidan took it all in his stride. He was honest and knew what we needed before we did...I had a Wishlist as long as my arm and he was able to make it all happen.
Incidentally we met at some awards where we were both finalists in the "best newcomer" category. We were delighted to congratulate Aidan on that one. But now we've a super functioning website we might try that one again!!

                             <p style="text-align: justify">We choose our fellow Irish company Avalanche to design our new website after coming across Aidan's impressive work on social media, we knew it was the correct choice straight away when we enquired about Aidan's background in sport and his skill in design meant it was the perfect match for us. We required a quick sleek design to update our old site and this was meet with ease by Aidan.

Quick, easy to work with, fun and adventurous is the best way to describe Avalanche, a pleasure to work with and more importantly to us was to shop local and support local business.

Many thanks again Aidan.

It came a time that my website had crashed into an abyss and needed to be rebuilt. I tried this myself but I really did need an expert.

Just check out their client list; a strong business portfolio. From a design perspective every site they have designed looks different. I found the whole process from start to finish very straight forward. Aidan, CEO of Avalanche was very professional to deal with and altogether he acted in my best interests and exceeded all expectations.

Aidan answered all our queries in rapid time and always kept us in the loop.

									<p style="text-align: justify">Having launched my high end millinery brand Elizabeth Christina Design in 2013 I had been looking for a web development company for some time. I was extremely conscious that I find a web designer that truly understood the concept and the brand. During my search I came across Avalanche and something about their unique style grasped my attention.

Aidan and his team are an absolute pleasure to deal with. Having only spoken to Aidan over the phone he completely understood what Elizabeth Christina Design was about and created the website I had envisioned for so long. He was able to grasp not just the brand but the personality behind the brand.

Aidan didn't set out to create the website he thought would suit Elizabeth Christina Design, instead he took the time to listen to everything I wanted to portray for my brand and created exactly what I wanted. I cannot recommend Aidan and his team enough, creative, professional, efficient but most importantly Aidan takes the time to listen to what his clients want. <strong>- Elizabeth Christina (Tina) Coyne, Elizabeth Christina Design.</strong></p>

I asked for a cool, contemporary and classy-looking site that would properly reflect the high standard of our product, present clear and concise information, be easy and straightforward to navigate and wouldn't cost a fortune. Within a few short weeks, that's exactly what I got. This pleasantly brief and productive journey with Avalanche has been hassle-free and I'm delighted with the result. From the outset, Aidan was 100% involved in designing and creating our new site. He was always available at the end of the phone and instantly familiar with every detail, incredibly efficient, extremely pleasant, positive and endlessly patient.

Having been so happy with the first website Aidan completed for us "Kissane Sheep Farm" we asked Avalanche to complete a new website for Adopt a Sheep.  Our aim was to give this site a new clean and modern feel and most important was to make it easy for the customers to Adopt a Sheep.

The final result has exceeded our expectations and the feedback from our customers is very positive.  We are receiving so much extra business since this website went live and the way he has integrated the eCommerce aspect with adoption renewals was an excellent idea. It has made the whole payment process very easy and has kept the entire process Irish with the addition of Stripe, which we are big believers in.

We are very happy to recommend Avalanche for any project where a great sense of creative design and imagination is involved as both of our websites have been a great success. We look forward to working with them in the coming months to further our online strategy.

That is what they were able to do, without any hassle and with real passion.  When we saw the first draft of the new website we were very impressed and the final product is excellent and brings us into a modern age.  

I really like the design used by Aidan and his team, "sleek & modern" was the brief and they delivered in spades. It is easy to get our message across to the customer.

We are very happy with our first website and a very positive feedback from our customers and tour operators from all over the world. It is easy to see that they went above and beyond for us.

Aidan has taken our branding and worked it beautifully into his website designs. The websites are exciting, clean and clever. As we are 'fussy' designers here, we wanted someone we could trust to be equally fussy about how the website designs looked and functioned. Aidan made changes and edits as they were required and never got tired (we hope!) of any updating and tweaking as the websites were perfected!

Aidan was very helpful and hands on. The site was created within days and fulfilled all of my expectations. Avalanche created the site on a charitable basis showing their support and understanding of what I am trying to achieve. I could not have picked a better company to come on board!

                           <p style="text-align: justify">I contacted Aidan from Avalanche are I had spent the last few years trying to do my own website. Hours and hours sitting in front of a computer screen, getting frustrated and still coming up blank. My website was plain, boring and "ok" at best. I wanted a website that showed off our business, ok was not good enough. So after spending nearly 12 hours one day driving myself mad trying to self design a website I said I need professional help. Having shopped around I met some really good and expensive companies but they were mechanical. I wanted something edgy but still professional, I needed someone with a creative touch and also the capacity to handle my unwillingness to let go of my own bad work in web design. I landed on the Avalanche website after a number of recommendations. It was a no-brainer after that. The quality of work was outstanding. So I made contact and was delighted with Aidan's approach from the start. Nothing was a problem and when I suggested crazy stuff he told me exactly what he thought. "This will work and that won't". I needed someone who understood where I was coming from but someone who could also add their own creative edge. In Aidan and Avalanche that's what I got. A balance between professionalism, creativity and honesty. Delighted with my website now and proud to tell people about it. My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner. It would have saved me time and energy and a bucket load of unnecessary stress. If you want your website revamped and or new website, I couldn't look past Avalanche. <strong>- Joe O' Connor, Nisus Fitness.</strong></p>

This is the second site we have had designed by Avalanche & we can safely say that this exciting firm is only getting better at what they do. Aidan in particular is a genius at what he does, a skilled coder and social media marketing guru all rolled into one.

                               <p style="text-align: justify">Like all good companies we heard about Avalanche through word of mouth. We heard that they were easy to deal with, fast to respond to issues and as a design company they were bursting with ideas. It was refreshing to deal with someone as enthusiastic about my own business as I am. There was someone always at the other end of the phone if I had questions and we got some great suggestions to what we could do with the site. Great to have Avalanche part of our eCommerce business. Thanks guys! ) <strong>- Chris Mack, The Brand Geeks.</strong></p>

									<p style="text-align: justify">Avalanche was recommended to us by a customer. After checking out there website I knew they were the company that I was looking for to re-design my website. There site is very different and imaginative. The message I got was they think outside the box and have original ideas just what I wanted and after talking with them I was happy to go ahead. I gave them free reign on the ideas and design and it paid off. We have a Lovely fresh looking new website. Thanks to all at Avalanche! <strong>- Simon Newell, Renewell Water.</strong></p>

									<p style="text-align: justify">I contacted Avalanche in December 2012 to redesign my website. Avalanche had been recommended by a friend. I am so pleased I made the call. Within 2 weeks the site was complete and it went live January 2nd 2013. I found Avalanche to be incredibly professional, attentive and very creative. Everything I required for the site was achieved without fuss and from the word go I had complete confidence in their abilities. Avalanche created a fantastic website that fits my Camping Pod brand image perfectly. My wife was so impressed she has hired them to redesign her website. Put simply, Avalanche really know what they are doing! <strong>- David Griffin, Pods Ireland.</strong></p>

									 <p style="text-align: justify">Avalanche are a joy to work with. As a young web design firm, they are very bright and in tune with technology. Most techno-heads are not creative, Aidan has a creative streak, and works from both sides of his frontal lobe, right and left side. Which means, he can build a very fine website for you technically, and he will know how to make it look great visually. He is open to changes and rarely says no, because to Aidan there is always a way around a problem. One more thing, Aidan is patient and laid back, which brings calm to the work being done, most efficiently. Avalanche are also wizards at social media. I highly recommend their work. <strong>- Rebecca Carroll, Artist.</strong></p>
